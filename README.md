# Multiplayer Minesweeper

Tech Stack:
frontend -> html, css, javascript
backend -> NodeJS

The goal is to use as little libraries or plugins to get a further understanding how each piece works without relying on an established library.

This project is meant solely for learning hence the lack of libraries, in a real world scenario, I would cater towards using established and tested libraries to speed up development if needed.
